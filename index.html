                        <p>Welcome!</p>
                        <p>
                            I am photographer based out of Pittsburgh, PA focusing in portraits, street, and fine art photographs. Telling stories has always been my passion, as I’ve long felt that photography is a medium that prompts more questions than answers. In telling my photographic stories I carry with me a strong belief in authenticity; a willingness to keep images true to life.

                            I’ve been fortunate enough to have received several distinctions, including a “Top-Rated Entry” in the Magnum Photography Awards 2017. I’ve also had my work published in several journals, including Collision Literary Magazine, Digging Through the Fat Press, Brainchild Literary Magazine of the Mid-East Honors Association, and the Print Swap (by Feature Shoot).
